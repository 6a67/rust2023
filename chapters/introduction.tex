\section{Introduction}
\noindent Rust is a modern, general-purpose programming language with several unique features that make it stand out from other languages.
Rusts memory safety and its focus on performance make it suitable for scenarios where performance and reliability are essential.
Over recent years, Rust has gained prominence and popularity \cite{sosurvey} and is being used in areas where other languages like C or \Cpp have been used in the past \cite{fbrust} \cite{rustchrome} \cite{rustfirefox}.
Rust currently gets adopted into both the Linux \cite{rustlinux} and the Windows Kernel \cite{rustwindows}.
Rust's structs, enums, and patterns provide powerful tools for organizing and manipulating data.
Understanding these core components is essential for working with data in Rust and using the language effectively.
This paper will explore these concepts and how to work with them.
They will be compared to their \Cpp counterparts to examine how they might be similar or different.
