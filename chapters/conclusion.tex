\section{Conclusion}
Rust and \Cpp exhibit significant similarities in handling structs and enums, sharing similar syntax and core concepts.
The most notable difference is that Rust does not allow for inheritance, which is a big part of \Cpp and a concept that was intentionally left out of Rust.
Rust extends these core concepts by adding more features, like enums that can hold data or the ability to implement functionality on enums.
Notably, Rust's pattern-matching syntax and control flow constructs surpass the capabilities of the switch statement in \Cpp, offering a broader range of possibilities beyond simple value comparisons.
Regarding memory layout, Rust, in practice, defaults to a more efficient layout than \Cpp but still allows control over the layout if needed.

In conclusion, Rust offers an equally powerful alternative to \Cpp, offering improved default behaviors and introducing new approaches to more advanced tasks.
